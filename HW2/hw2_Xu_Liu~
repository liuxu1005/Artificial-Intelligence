1. 
a) Expand list from Toolbank to Scary with A*:
   Tookbank, Tuckborough, Waymeet, Bywater, Hobbiton, Overhill, Frogmorton, Stock, Oatbarton, Whitefurrows, Budgeford, Scary

b) It is optimal path.  
   Since the heuristic function is consistency. And this is a A* alogrithm for graph version.

c) The maximum should be 16.
   Since for  the three successor stations:
        Tookbank: f(n) = 30,  
        Stock: f(n) = 40
        Bywater: f(n) =  ? + 13
   The ? must be less than 17 to be expanded first.

1.1
   We need the ratio between MD and ED to judge addmisibility based on
   information from question 1.
   We know ED is addmissible since it is less than optimal path cost.
  
   Frodo's : 1/2 * ED
   Sam's: 2 * ED 
   are admissible
   According to the ED table, ED and 2 * ED are less than or equal to the optimal path cost,
   They will not mislead us.


   We are not sure if 
   Merry's : 1/3 * MD + 1/3 *ED
   Pippin's :3*MD + 3/2 *ED
   are addmissible or not, we need ratio of MD over ED to calculate the heuristic function.
